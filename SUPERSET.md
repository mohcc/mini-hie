Given that you are using Docker and possibly a custom `docker-compose.yml` setup, ensure the database initialization step is included and correctly executed. For Superset, this usually involves running the `superset db upgrade` command to apply database migrations, which create the necessary tables in the database.

Since you're working within a Docker environment, here's a step you should ensure is included either in your Dockerfile or as part of your container startup command:

1. **Database Initialization**

The database initialization and admin user creation are typically done after the Superset service has started. This can be automated by overriding the container's command or entrypoint with a custom script that runs the necessary initialization commands.

If you haven't done this yet or if it failed for some reason, you can manually run the commands by executing them inside your running Superset container. Here's how you can do it:

- **Step 1**: Find your running Superset container's name or ID using `docker ps`.

- **Step 2**: Execute an interactive shell in your container. Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with your container's name or ID from step 1.
  
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash
  ```

- **Step 3**: Inside the container, run the following commands to upgrade the database and initialize Superset. This will ensure that all required tables are created.

  ```bash
  superset db upgrade
  superset init
  ```

- **Step 4** (Optional): If you haven't already created an admin user, you can do so by running:

  ```bash
  superset fab create-admin
  ```

  Follow the prompts to enter the admin user's details.

After running these commands, exit the container shell (`exit` or Ctrl+D), and your Superset instance should now be properly initialized with all necessary database tables created.

If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` file and any custom scripts are correctly configured, particularly with regards to database service dependencies and volume mappings that may affect the persistence of your database data.
